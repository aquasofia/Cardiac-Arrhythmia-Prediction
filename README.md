# Cardiac Arrythmia Prediction

A model for classifying different types of cardiac arrythmia. 

## Description

Model consists from following python files:
- cnn (class definition for the cnn)
- dataset (class definition for the dataset)
- training (program for data processing and training functions)
- file_io (program for disk i/o read write operations)
- data_init (program for data initialization)


```bash
pip install torch
pip install tensorflow
```

## Use and development


Model utilizes the PyTorch Librariries:

- Module      for implemetation of the Convolutional Neural Network
- Dataset     to store classification data (features, labels)
- Dataloader  to load data from a custom Dataset object

```python
# Dataloader returns features and class for a given index
x, y = Dataloader()

```
